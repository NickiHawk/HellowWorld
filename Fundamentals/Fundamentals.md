 ```py                                                       Python Fundamentals
Primitive Types
    Numbers - Intergers, floating point numbers(decimals)
    Strings - words phrases, literal text
    Booleans - True or False

Composite Types (A collection of primitive Data Types)
    List - A type of data is is mutable and cond hold a group of values(Arrays)
    Dictionaries - A group of key-value pairs. Dictionary elements are indexed by unique keys which are accessed to values
    Tuples - A type of data this is immutable and can hold a group of values

Common FUnctions
    - Print()
    -len() - finds the length of a value
    -Type() - confirms what type of data a value is

Strings
F-Strings - first_name = "Zen"
last_name = "Coder"
age = 27
print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name} and I am {age} years old.")


embeddings a string %f
embedding an interger %d

.append() - attached to a variable can add a value to the end of a list

for loop -      for x in range(5):
                    print(x)


While loop-     count = 0
                while count <= 5:
                    print("looping -".
                    count)
                    count +=1
